To Run the program on AWS:
 
1. Create S3 bucket add policies to get, put, list and delete objects in permissions. 
- Upload the files : 1. Model_1_state.pth
		      2. Model_2_state.pth
in S3 bucket.

2. Create an Event in SNS and add your mail id to get resultant notifications and not forget to confirm the mail id.

3. Create IAM Roles to give access to S3 and SNS to Lambda Function and add those n configuration in AWS Lambda.

4. Run a container using docker desktop and follow the push commands provided by AWS ECR to Push the docker image in your ECR lambda-repo.
- Using AWS CLI in local system generate docker image of file my_lambda_function (it will download and push all the dependencies required to run the program on AWS).

5. Add the latest image in AWS Lambda.

6. You can test if the program is running by uploading a .csv file in this i uploaded Testing.csv or you can run a json Test Event code in AWS Lambda to run .csv file already present in S3 bucket.
